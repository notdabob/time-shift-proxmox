look at @README.md and @requirements.txt and all of the scripts in @bin and analyze them. My concern is I do not feel you are being modular and robust with your design in regards to how dependencies are handled and doing simple things like in @README.md step 4 is ridiculous, why
chmod +x a singular python binary in that folder... makes way more sense to "chmod +x bin/_.py" similarly it makes zero sense how step 2 for install required python dependencies works the end user shouldn't be troubled with figuring out if they have the pip3 or python3 command
installed you should be testing for all of these requirements and cleanly resolving all of this setup and configuration step in a singular script. I would like to see all of this simplified down into like 2 steps with the first one for the cloning the repo to not just be a text
label but actually has the script commands to do the git clone to our actual github repository url etc... make it simple. the second step should do the "chmod +x bin/_.py && ./bin/setup-project-requirements.py" which is where you will move all of this tedius setup steps into a
more condensed and clean way. Also be sure that @requirements.txt is contextually aware of when it's for the requirements of the scripts running on our proxmox host as part of time-shift-proxmox project itself and when it's for running within our vm that gets created for the
requirements for those scripts. Be sure to analyze those scripts as I mentioned before to ensure all the details such as jq, pandoc, pdflatex, pip3, python3 etc are all handled and in the appropriate order of operations as to which is needed when in our list of requirements i.e.
python3 is probably one of the very first things that should be in our requirements list for both projects and then pip3 etc... etc....
